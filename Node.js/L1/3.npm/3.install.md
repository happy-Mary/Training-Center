# Install

There is a simple syntax to install any Node.js module:
```
$ npm install <Module Name>
```

For example, following is the command to install a famous Node.js web framework module
called express:
```
$ npm install lodash
```

Now you can use this module in your js file as following:
```
var express = require('lodash');
```

## The --save and --save-dev install flags

The easier (and more awesome) way to add dependencies to your package.json is to do so from the command line, flagging the npm install command with either --save or --save-dev, depending on how you'd like to use that dependency.

To add an entry to your package.json's dependencies:
```
$ npm install <package_name> --save
```

To add an entry to your package.json's devDependencies:
```
$ npm install <package_name> --save-dev
```

If you do not want to install devDependencies you simply can use
``` 
$ npm install --production
```

## Global vs Local Installation
   
By default, NPM installs any dependency in the local mode. Here local mode refers to the
package installation in node_modules directory lying in the folder where Node application
is present. Locally deployed packages are accessible via require() method. For example,
when we installed express module, it created node_modules directory in the current
directory where it installed the express module.
```
$ npm install <Module Name> -g
```
